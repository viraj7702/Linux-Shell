# Linux-Shell
Implemented a Linux Shell in C
- Worked with processes and signals to implement a shell. The shell supports program execution
with command-line options if applicable. Programs can be executed in the background or
foreground.
- Built-in commands that the shell supports include bg <jobID> (runs a suspended job in the
background), cd [path] (changes current directory to the given path), fg <jobID> (runs a
suspended or background job in the foreground), and more.
